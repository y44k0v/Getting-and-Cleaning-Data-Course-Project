[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) was the source of the data for this project.



## Variable name description:

subject- A group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  
activity - Each person performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)



    1.'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
    2. Accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ
    3. Body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) 
    4. The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to 
    obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
    5. The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using 
    the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
    6.Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
    fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 

The variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
    
    mean(): Mean value
    std(): Standard deviation
